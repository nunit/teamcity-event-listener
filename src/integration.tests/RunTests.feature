Feature: User runs tests

Background:
    Given NUnit path is ..\nunit\

@3.4.1
Scenario Outline: User runs tests for several assemblies
    Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>
    And I created the folder mocks
    And I copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
    And I added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests	
    And I added NUnit framework references to foo.tests	
    
    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo1.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo1.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies

    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo2.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo2.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies

    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo3.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo3.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies

    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo4.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo4.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies

    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo5.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo5.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies

    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo6.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo6.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
    
    And I want to use <configurationType> configuration type
    And I added the arg workers=10 to NUnit console command line
    And I added the arg agents=<agents> to NUnit console command line
    And I added the arg process=<process> to NUnit console command line
    And I added the arg domain=<domain> to NUnit console command line

    When I run NUnit console
    And the output should contain correct set of TeamCity service messages
    And the Test Run Summary should has following:
    | field        | value |
    | Test Count   | 6     |
    | Passed       | 6     |
    | Failed       | 0     |
    | Inconclusive | 0     |
    | Skipped      | 0     |
