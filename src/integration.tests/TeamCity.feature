Feature: NUnit should support TeamCity	

Background:
    Given NUnit path is ..\nunit\

@3.4.1

Scenario Outline: NUnit sends TeamCity service messages when I run successful test for NUnit3
    Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>
    And I added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests
    And I created the folder mocks
    And I added NUnit framework references to foo.tests
    And I copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll	
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
    And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
    When I run NUnit console
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the output should contain correct set of TeamCity service messages
    And the output should contain TeamCity service messages:

    Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>
    And I added PassWithText method as PassTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests
    And I created the folder mocks
    And I copied the reference ..\..\packages\NUnit.2.6.4\lib\nunit.framework.dll to folder mocks

    And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
    When I run NUnit console
    Then the exit code should be 0

    And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
	And I added the environment variable TEAMCITY_COLON_REPLACEMENT as Abc
    When I run NUnit console
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the output should contain correct set of TeamCity service messages

Scenario Outline: NUnit sends TeamCity service messages when I run it for one time TearDown with output
    Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>	
    And I added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests
    And I added OneTimeTearDownWithOutput method as OneTimeTearDownWithOutput to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests
    And I created the folder mocks
    And I added NUnit framework references to foo.tests
    And I copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
    And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
    When I run NUnit console
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the output should contain correct set of TeamCity service messages
    And the output should contain TeamCity service messages:

Scenario: Generate suite name according to variable TEAMCITY_NUNIT_SUITE_PATTERN when assembly name replacement
    Given Framework version is Version45
    And I added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests
    And I created the folder mocks
    And I added NUnit framework references to foo.tests
    And I copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
    And I compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll
    And I added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
    And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
    And I added the environment variable TEAMCITY_NUNIT_SUITE_PATTERN as x64_{a}_abc
    When I run NUnit console
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And the output should contain correct set of TeamCity service messages
    And the output should contain TeamCity service messages:
